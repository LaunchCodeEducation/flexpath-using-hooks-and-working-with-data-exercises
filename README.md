5. **Fetching Data and Error Handling**:
    
    - Fetching data using async/await and promises.
    - Handling loading states and errors effectively.
    - Using a mock API to simulate real-world data fetching.
6. **Performance Optimization**:
    
    - Using hooks like `useCallback` and `useMemo` for optimization.
    - Techniques to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
